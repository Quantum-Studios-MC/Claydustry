Let's play with clay!!

This repository builds the Claydustry modpack.  The GitHub Actions workflow
runs **only when a release is published**.  You can initiate a build by
creating a new release (or pushing a tag and then publishing it) and the
resulting ZIP will be attached directly to that release.  No personal access
token is required.

Artifacts are **not** stored under Actions; instead download the pack from the
release page (the workflow adds it automatically).  This mirrors how the
GregTech pack does direct releases.
